# VBA Macros

This folder contains a collection of VBA macros developed to automate and
optimize daily work tasks within a professional environment.

The macros are primarily focused on practical functionality and real-world
problem-solving. As a result, they prioritize effective automation over
extensive error handling or strict stylistic enforcement.
